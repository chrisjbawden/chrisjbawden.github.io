    <h2>TL;DR</h2>
    <p>
      Download numbers on image hubs (e.g. Docker Hub) are easy to game and should not be used as a proxy for
      <strong>functionality</strong> or <strong>legitimacy</strong>. Treat them as a rough popularity signal at best,
      never as evidence that an image is safe, trustworthy, or maintained.
    </p>

    <h2>What I tested</h2>
    <p>
      As a security experiment, I tested whether automated traffic could artificially increase a container image‚Äôs
      download tally. By repeatedly querying an image‚Äôs metadata and simulating client activity within platform limits,
      I was able to make the public ‚Äúpulls‚Äù figure climb without any real users actually running the image.
    </p>

    <p>
      This isn‚Äôt unique to one platform‚Äîany metric that increments on easily triggered events (for example,
      unauthenticated or low-friction API interactions) can be inflated. The specifics vary by registry and will change
      over time as providers tighten abuse controls, but the broader lesson stands: <strong>vanity counters are weak security signals</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2>Why this matters</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Security theatre:</strong> Big numbers can create a false sense of safety. Malicious or low-quality images can look ‚Äúpopular‚Äù.</li>
      <li><strong>Herd bias:</strong> Humans tend to assume that if many others chose something, it must be right. Attackers exploit this.</li>
      <li><strong>Due-diligence gaps:</strong> Teams under time pressure may shortcut reviews if an image appears widely used.</li>
      <li><strong>Supply-chain risk:</strong> Trusting a misleading metric can pull vulnerable, outdated or tampered artefacts into your build path.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Better signals to assess images</h2>
    <p>Instead of leaning on download counts, prioritise:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Provenance:</strong> Is the image from an official or verified publisher? Is the namespace legitimate?</li>
      <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Public <code>Dockerfile</code>, build recipe, and clearly documented base images.</li>
      <li><strong>Freshness &amp; maintenance:</strong> Recent releases, tagged versions, changelogs, and timely CVE responses.</li>
      <li><strong>Image attestations &amp; signatures:</strong> Use standard tools to verify that the image you pull is what the publisher built.</li>
      <li><strong>SBOM &amp; vulnerability scans:</strong> Prefer images that ship an SBOM and pass baseline scanning in your own pipeline.</li>
      <li><strong>Reproducibility:</strong> Where feasible, build from source in your CI and compare digests against what you plan to run.</li>
      <li><strong>Least privilege:</strong> Check for non-root execution, minimal base layers, and sensible defaults.</li>
      <li><strong>Community signals with context:</strong> Issues, PRs, maintainer responsiveness‚Äîqualitative signals beat raw counters.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Practical takeaways for teams</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Treat download counts as <em>marketing</em>, not security evidence.</li>
      <li>Adopt a lightweight image admission policy (signatures, allow-lists, minimum metadata, CVE thresholds).</li>
      <li>Automate registry-side checks in CI (digest pinning, SBOM import, scan gates).</li>
      <li>Periodically review base images and lock to known-good digests.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Responsible behaviour</h2>
    <p>
      This post is about awareness, not exploitation. Avoid automating fake traffic against public services.
      If you discover a counting weakness, follow a responsible disclosure process with the provider.
