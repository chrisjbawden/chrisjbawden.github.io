  Below is a link to a script that can extract stored Wi-Fi passwords - which can be handy if you forgot the wireless password and dont want to go through the hassel of trying to access the router and retrieve that information. Useful for those in the ICT domains and but perhaps a reminder for users to clear there wifi history before returning/surrendering an asset.
