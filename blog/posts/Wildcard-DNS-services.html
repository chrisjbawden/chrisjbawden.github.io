This is probably more for myself, just a reminder about wildcard DNS services for IP to Domain solutions.

  For anyone not familar, these services allow you to use the IP of the device as the domain. Their DNS services just resolve the domain to the IP as to allow you the use the advantages of a FQD - ie if you are using a reverse proxy.
