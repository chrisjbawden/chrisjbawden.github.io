<title> Handy wildcard DNS services</title>
<p>
This is mostly a note to myself, but it might help others too — a quick reminder about wildcard DNS services that map an IP address directly into a domain name.
</p>
<p>
For example, an IP like <code>1.1.1.1</code> can automatically be turned into a domain such as <code>1.1.1.1.nip.io</code>. The DNS for these services simply resolves that domain back to the same IP, giving you the benefits of a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) — which can be especially handy when setting up a reverse proxy.
</p>
<p>
However, while this is a great trick for quick setups and testing, there’s an important caveat: getting a Let’s Encrypt SSL certificate for these domains can be difficult. These free DNS-to-IP services are heavily used, and Let’s Encrypt rate limits often kick in due to the high volume of certificate requests from other users.
