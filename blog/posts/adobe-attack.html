<h3>Attack scenario - Adobe</h3>
<p>This blog outlines a theoretical attack scenario involving Adobe Reader and embedded PDFs — purely for educational purposes.<br><br>
The attack begins with a victim receiving an apparently legitimate PDF attachment via email. This PDF uses embedded JavaScript and auto-launch mechanisms to redirect the user to a website hosting a second-stage payload. Combined with a vulnerable version of Adobe Reader, this could enable arbitrary code execution.<br><br>
It’s also an example of social engineering — the document claims to contain financial or HR content to provoke curiosity.<br><br>

⚠️ This is not a real attack — it is a proof of concept for red team exercises, awareness training, and demonstrating the need for email attachment scanning.</p>
