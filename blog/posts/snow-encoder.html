<h3>ServiceNow URL Encoder</h3>
<p>You know how sometimes the links from ServiceNow (SNOW) won't work when you put them into a Word document? This is often due to Wordâ€™s encoding. While a registry fix exists, it's not practical for external recipients.<br><br>
This tool modifies the URL so it works across Word. Copy, paste, done.<br><br>
